title: "DrawIO Diagram Rules"
content: |
  When creating diagrams with draw.io, follow these rules:

  ## mxGraphModel Settings
  - Set defaultFontFamily="FontName" in mxGraphModel
  - Add fontFamily=FontName; to style of all text elements
  - Use font size 1.5x standard (around 18px)

  ## Layout Rules
  - Place arrows at the beginning of XML (backmost layer)
  - Keep arrows and labels at least 20px apart
  - Allocate sufficient width for Japanese text (30-40px per character)
  - Do not set background color (keep transparent)
  - Set page="0"

  ## Post-Creation Checklist
  - [ ] All text elements have fontFamily explicitly set
  - [ ] Font size is sufficient (18px or larger recommended)
  - [ ] Arrows are placed at backmost layer
  - [ ] Arrows and labels do not overlap
  - [ ] Japanese text has no unintended line breaks
  - [ ] Visually verified with PNG export

  ## Key Points (CRITICAL)
  1. **fontFamily must be explicit** on each text element
  2. **Arrows at backmost layer** - avoid overlap with labels
  3. **Always verify visually with PNG export**
