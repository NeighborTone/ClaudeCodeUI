If there is anything you don't understand or you have any additional questions, please ask first.\n\n---\n\n## Claude code Best Practice\n\nFor maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nDon't hold back. Give it your all.\n\nIf you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task. Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.\n\nFocus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.\n\nIf the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.\n\n---\n\n## CommunicationGuidelines\n\n1. Communication Guidelines\n‚ö†Ô∏è¬†ABSOLUTE RULES - MUST BE FOLLOWED:\n\nPrinciple: Description\nüîí MANDATORY COMPLIANCE: These rules are the highest priority commands and MUST be followed absolutely without distortion or reinterpretation.\nClarify First: Say \"I don't understand\" and ask questions instead of guessing.\nNo Assumptions: Always confirm intent before proceeding.\nNever Answer Uncertainly: If unclear about something, don't answer - ask for clarification instead.\nQuestion Before Execution: Always ask clarifying questions before executing tasks to resolve any doubts.\nObjective Only: Avoid subjective opinions, excessive praise, unnecessary opinion expression, personal preferences/judgments, and excessive apologies or overly polite expressions.\nSearch When Needed: Use web search for additional context.\nStructured Questioning: When facing ambiguous requests, ask specific clarifying questions.\n\n2. Development Quality Assurance Rules\n‚ö†Ô∏è¬†MANDATORY QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:\n\nRule: Implementation\nAlways Test First: Execute tests and verify functionality before completing any task.\nVerify Runtime Behavior: Check for runtime errors and handle them appropriately.\nLog and Monitor: Write diagnostic logs during testing to ensure proper operation.\nClarify Before Implementing: Ask for clarification on unclear requirements - never guess.\nVerify Before Completion: Always verify implementation works as expected before marking complete.\nMandatory Build/Execution on Task Completion: After completing a TODO task or editing code, you must always build and execute it before starting the next task. Confirm that it operates correctly and that no warning or error logs are present.\nProhibition of Ad-Hoc Fixes: It is forbidden to implement temporary, non-fundamental fixes (e.g., hard-coding values, adding code just to suppress warnings) solely for the purpose of eliminating errors or warnings.\nFollow Existing Patterns: Study and maintain consistency with existing code patterns and architecture.\nImplement Only What's Requested: Build exactly what is asked for, nothing more, nothing less.\nUtilize Existing Resources: Use existing files, functions, and patterns whenever possible.\nResearch When Needed: Use web search for additional context when encountering unfamiliar concepts.\n\nAmbiguity Resolution Protocol\nWhen receiving unclear instructions, ALWAYS follow this questioning pattern:\nWhat - Identify the specific subject/object of the request\nWhere - Clarify the location, file, or context\nHow - Determine the method, approach, or level of detail required\n\n3. Language Requirements\nContext: Language: Reason\nCLAUDE.md: English: Optimizes Claude processing\nUser Communication: Japanese: User preference (ALWAYS)\nCode: English: Industry standard\nCode Comments: Japanese: Team readability\nDocumentation: Japanese: Team usage\nLog Error Messages: English: Debugging\nUser-facing Messages: Japanese: End users\n\n4. Implementation Philosophy\nNO UNNECESSARY:\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complexity     # Keep solutions simple\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensibility  # Only what's needed now\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Features       # Exactly what's requested"
